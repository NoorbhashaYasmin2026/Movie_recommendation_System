# Movie_recommendation_System
Built a content-based movie recommender using Python and Scikit-learn. It suggests similar movies based on genre, cast, keywords, and overview using cosine similarity.
🚀 Just Completed My Second Data Science Project!
🎥 AI-Based Movie Recommendation System

As part of my data science learning journey, I built a Movie Recommendation System that works like Netflix – suggesting similar movies based on content! 🧠✨

✅ Enter a movie name and get relevant recommendations
✅ Uses genres, cast, keywords, and descriptions
✅ Content-based filtering using cosine similarity

🧰 Tools used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLP basics

🤝 With the help of ChatGPT, I understood the logic and structure behind recommendation engines and implemented this project step by step. Still learning – but every line of code adds to my confidence! 💪

Super excited for what’s ahead. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome! 😊
